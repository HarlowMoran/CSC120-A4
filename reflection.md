- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I still feel like I could use some practice with encapsulation. I feel like I understand the concept of how different classes are interconnected, but once it was time to put it in practice, I felt a lot more uncertain. In general, I understand the idea of how two different classes may need to share and access the same information, and how one class my fall under a "sub-catagory" of another class. However when I have to write out the code for this encapsulation, I feel a little unsure if I am doing it correctly.

I definitely felt like this assignment was easier than the last. And as I learn from the last assignment, TA hours are my friend. But other than a few debugging issues, I felt pretty confident that I understood how to go through this assignment without any assistance or prompting. (That being said, I am sure there are things I did wrong. But for this assignment I felt a lot less lost than the last.)
